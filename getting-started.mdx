Public apps that are created in the Partner Dashboard must obtain authorization using the OAuth 2.0 specification to use AfterShip’s API resources.

## 1. Create a public app

Prepare following information:

| Field    | Required? | Description                                                                                          |
| -------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| App Name | ✔         | The app's public name                                                                                |
| Tagline  | ✔         | &#xA;Merchants should be able to understand the purpose of the app and the benefits from the tagline |

## 2. Get the permission consent

Before your app can access any merchant's data, the merchant has to grant permission to the app. The merchant grants permission when they install the app. When the merchant clicks the `install` button to initiate the installation process, the merchant's browser will be redirected to ShipBob to install your app.

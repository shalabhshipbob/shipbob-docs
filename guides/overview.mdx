ShipBob’s public API supports a variety of different use cases. This guide shows most common scenarios that you can create using ShipBob’s public APIs.

You can create a typical integration using the following endpoints:

* [Order POST](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs/#tag/Orders/paths/~11.0~1order/post) – This allows you to create orders in ShipBob. Example API request is found in the documentation linked.

* [Order GET](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs/#tag/Orders/paths/~11.0~1order/get) – This allows you to fetch tracking details from ShipBob if you want to take a polling/scheduled based approach.

  * You can also subscribe to our webhooks if you’d like to automatically receive shipment events [here](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs/#tag/Webhooks).

* [Inventory GET](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs/#tag/Inventory/paths/~11.0~1inventory~1%7BinventoryId%7D/get) – This allows you to fetch inventory levels across ShipBob’s facility network. This endpoint will return per-facility inventory levels as well as aggregated inventory levels across the network.

  * The following inventory quantity calculations are available:

    * **On hand** quantities are everything currently stocked at the warehouse.

    * **Fulfillable** quantities are everything stocked at the warehouse minus quantities committed to orders.

    * **Sellable** quantities are everything stocked at the warehouse, minus quantities committed to orders, minus any exception orders. This calculation is only available at a network-wide level.

* Authentication is handled either via OAuth or a token-based approach. For a custom integration, we typically see the token approach used – you are able to generate an API token directly in your ShipBob dashboard. Steps [here](https://developer.shipbob.com/auth).

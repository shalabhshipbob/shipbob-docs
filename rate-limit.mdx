API calls will be rate-limited to 150 requests per-minute using a sliding window, and will be totalled per user, per application across calls to any of the Shipbob APIs.

Please give us time to process your requests. If you're sending too many requests too quickly, we'll respond with a 429 error code (TooManyRequests).

The API response headers also give you the following rate limit detailed information:

| Header                | **Example** | **Description**                                          |
| --------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| X-RateLimit-Reset     | 1406096275  | The Unix timestamp when the rate limit will be reset.    |
| X-RateLimit-Limit     | 20          | The rate limit ceiling for the current endpoint per sec. |
| X-RateLimit-Remaining | 19          | The number of requests left for the 1-second window.     |

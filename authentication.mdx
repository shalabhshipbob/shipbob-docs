title: 'Authentication'
description: 'You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the ShipBob API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. ShipBob offers two ways to authenticate your API requests: Basic authentication and OAuth2 with a token â€” OAuth2 is the recommended way.'

## Basic Authentication

With basic authentication, you use your username and password to authenticate your HTTP requests. Unless you have a very good reason, you probably shouldn't use basic auth. Here's how to authenticate using cURL:


## OAuth Flow
To finish the authentication process, your app will have to do the following:

1. Request a client ID and client secret.
2. Request authorization from a ShipBob user.
3. Retrieve an authorization code from a provided callback.
4. Exchange the authorization code for an access token.
5. Begin making API calls.

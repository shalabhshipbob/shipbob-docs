## Creating Orders

ShipBob’s Order POST endpoint has several required fields that you need to be aware of:

* Shipping method: This is typically a value such as “Standard”, “Expedited”, “2-Day”, etc. Once a ship method comes through via the integration, the merchant will have the ability to map the method to a specific Ship Option that will determine the shipment’s SLA and carrier selection. More detail on Ship Options can be found in our help center here.

* Recipient name - The name of the individual the shipment will be delivered to.

* Recipient address – specifically the Address1, City, and Country (ISO Alpha-2 code is highly recommended). If available, please also pass the City and Zip Code.

* Reference id – This is a unique order number from the upstream platform being integrated with ShipBob. This number must be unique within ShipBob account.
  You can also pass an optional order\_number field. This does not need to be unique, and is a more user-friendly order number that a customer service agent might be more familiar with.

* Products – There are two methods for providing product data with your order payload to ShipBob:

  * ReferenceId Model (highly recommended) – This model allows you to pass a product’s reference\_id (typically the SKU value), as well as the product name. When an order is created, ShipBob will check if the product already exists based on a matching reference\_id, and will automatically create a new product if one does not already exist.
    This model is recommended as you do not need to store any external ShipBob product id values to create an order successfully. It also has the ability to auto-create products if they do not exist based on the duplicate match of a reference\_id value.

  * ProductId Model – This model requires that you pass ShipBob’s ProductId as part of the order payload to create the order. This will mean that you first must create a product using ShipBob’s Product API and have a method to either store or reference the ShipBob-generated ProductId to use as part of your order creation process.

    * This model works best if you always create products in ShipBob prior to sending any orders, and have a way to store the ProductId somewhere upstream.

When viewing the API documentation, you can toggle between each model by expanding the Product node:

In addition to the required fields highlighted above, you also have the ability to pass order tags to ShipBob. Tags are an array that consists of a name, value pair which can be used to store additional data that might be needed with your platform upstream, and can also trigger automation rules that have been created in ShipBob.

More details on available rules can be found here.

To trigger a rule created within ShipBob, the order tag **name** must match the rule. As an example, if you desire to pass a tag that triggers a rule to automatically add a marketing insert to specific orders, your tag structure may look like:



```
"tags": [
  {
    "name": "AddMarketingInsert",
    "value": "NotUsedForRuleTrigger"
  },
  {
    "name": "Subscription First Order",
    "value": "0"
  }
],
```

Where the tag “name” value of “AddMarketingInsert” is what will be used to trigger a rule created in ShipBob.

Lastly, you will need to also specific a **`shipbob_channel_id`** within the request header to successfully create an order. To find which channel you have write access to, you can call the [GET Channel](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs#tag/Channels/paths/~11.0~1channel/get) endpoint to view a list of permissions you have access to under each channel. You will only have write access for one channel (your own integration channel), but you typically will have the ability to read data across other channels.

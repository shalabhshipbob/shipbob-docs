title: Introduction
description:  ShipBob is a technology-first fulfillment & storage provider for e-commerce merchants. 
---

With a distributed network of fulfillment centers across the US, we allow fast, affordable shipping to thousands of customers. Read more about us [here](https://www.shipbob.com/about/).

There are two methods of using this API: a "Personal Access Token (PAT)" for single-merchant or custom integrations, and an OAuth 2.0 process for general-purpose integrations or those that will be listed on ShipBob's App Marketplace. Please see the Auth tab for more details.

## API Access

Before you are able to interact with ShipBob's API, you must have an account. Accounts are free until physical inventory arrives, and the trial period does not expire.

## Support & Rate Limits
If you have questions, please email our Developer Support Team at developers@shipbob.com. This will create a ticket with a 1-business day first response time.

API calls will be rate-limited to 150 requests per-minute using a sliding window, and will be totalled per user, per application across calls to any of the Shipbob APIs.

## Terminology & Concepts
A channel is a specific installation of an application built by a vendor on top of our API – e.g. “Kevin’s Shopify Store #133432” would be 1 channel
A multi-channel application can read data from all channels that belong to the merchant but can only write data on behalf of its own channel - e.g. multi-channel "app #555" can read data from "Kevin's Shopify Store #133432" but can only write data on behalf of "app #555".

openapi: get /channel

Use the Channel Resource to list “channels” which you have access to. You will use this channelId for subsequent API calls made to ShipBob endpoints.

A channel is a specific installation of an application built by a vendor on top of our API – e.g. Kevin’s Shopify Store #133432. All write and most read endpoints require a channel to be passed in the header to complete the request. The channel is used to Identify where the data originally came from.

Applications that are granted multi-channel permissions will be able to read data from all channels that belong to a user. However, multi-channel applications will only be able to write on behalf of their own channel.

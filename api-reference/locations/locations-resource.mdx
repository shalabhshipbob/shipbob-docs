Use this API to interact with the physical locations across ShipBob's fulfillment network. An active ShipBob location is operational for fulfillment processes, including receiving inventory and processing returns. It's important to note that some locations, access is granted to all merchants by default, while some locations require special request for merchants to be granted access. For each location, determine if it can be leveraged for the user by viewing the access\_granted & receiving\_enabled fields.

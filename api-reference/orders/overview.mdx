Use the Orders Resource to create and retrieve orders in ShipBob.

An order a digital record of a complete purchase that comes from an upstream source (i.e. Shopify) and is intended for ShipBob to fulfill. The order object includes products purchased, shipping address details, shipping method selected etc. Orders are created in ShipBob via a channel.

When ShipBob fulfills the order, one or more shipments are created for that order. A shipment is a record of the physical package(s) sent out via a carrier. If an order is shipped in multiple packages then 2 or more shipments can be created for that order.

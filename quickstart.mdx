This quickstart guide intends to walk you through a few common scenarios to let you understand how to use the ShipBob API.

## 1. Get API key

ShipBob verifies a user's request by using a Bearer token in the header. We call this a Personal Access Token.

On the ShipBob dashboard, go to **Integrations** > **API Tokens**. Click Generate New Token. Copy this token as we will use in next step. If you do not have a ShipBob account yet, you can create a sandbox account by following [this link](https://webstage.shipbob.dev/app/merchant/#/SignUp).&#x20;

## 2. Make your first API request

Use your PAT token to make a request to the GET Channels endpoint. You will need the channel ID to create products, orders and returns with the ShipBob API.

```
GET https://api.shipbob.com/1.0/channel
```

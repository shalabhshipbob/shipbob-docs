## Sandbox/Test Accounts

Every ShipBob account starts in "demo mode" and you can cancel orders that do not have physical inventory assigned. So it's possible to test in a production account. If you don't have an account yet, you can sign up for one [here](https://web.shipbob.com/app/merchant/#/SignUp).

However, if you want to simulate more complex operations you can use our new Sandbox API. Please sign up for an account, then request sandbox credentials using the same form you used to request API access (on the home page of this site).

<Note>Click the "clear demo data" step on the onboarding page before sending test orders.</Note>

```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    subgraph subgraph1
        direction TB
        top1[top] --> bottom1[bottom]
    end
    subgraph subgraph2
        direction TB
        top2[top] --> bottom2[bottom]
    end
    %% ^ These subgraphs are identical, except for the links to them:

    %% Link *to* subgraph1: subgraph1 direction is maintained
    outside --> subgraph1
    %% Link *within* subgraph2:
    %% subgraph2 inherits the direction of the top-level graph (LR)
    outside ---> top2
```

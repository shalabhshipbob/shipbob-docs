This API lets you create shipping labels, cancel shipping labels and sync tracking numbers for orders processed through ShipBob Logistics. It’s straightforward to integrate and works in both sandbox and production environments.

To get started, you’ll need a ShipBob sandbox account. Sign up [here](https://webstage.shipbob.dev/app/merchant/#/SignUp?utm_source=app_partner). Once you have signed up, reach out to your ShipBob representative with next steps—they’ll guide you through the process and provide the necessary credentials.

ShipBob's Developer API allows 2 forms of authentication, depending on the use case: Personal Access Token (PAT) or OAuth 2.0.

* If you're building a single-user custom integration, you can use the Personal Access Token (PAT) method. This generates a ready-to-use bearer-type token with full access to the merchant's account.

  * You can generate credentials from the ShipBob dashboard.

    * For Production Environment, [click here](https://web.shipbob.com/app/merchant/#/Integrations/token-management).

    * For Sandbox Environment, [click here](https://webstage.shipbob.dev/app/merchant/#/Integrations/token-management).

* If you are building an integration or app that will be multi-user or listed on our App Store, you must use the OAuth flow.

  * You can request credentials by filling out the form [here](https://forms.office.com/r/AYx81v67MD).

<Note>All API authentication operates against the root user of the account. When requesting a PAT token or installing an OAuth app, you should do so against the root user.</Note>

## Personal Access Token (PAT) Flow

When you request your first PAT, ShipBob automatically generates an application (called "SMA" or single-merchant application) and [channel](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs#tag/Channels) to house all your future PATs. You can request as many as you like, and revoke them at any time.

<Note>These tokens do not expire, so be extremely cautious when sharing them.</Note>

Your PAT should automatically have read and write access to the entire ShipBob account.

To use your PAT, just provide the token as an Authorization header formatted like this:

```
Bearer [your_api_token]
```

First you should use your PAT to hit the [GET Channel](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs#tag/Channels) endpoint, so you can use your channel ID in the headers of subsequent API calls. Your response will look like this:

```
{
    "id": 56232,
    "name": "Personal Access Token Thursday, June 1, 2024",
    "application_name": "SMA",
    "scopes": [
        "channels_read, orders_read, orders_write, products_read, products_write, receiving_read, receiving_write, returns_read, returns_write, inventory_read"
    ] 
}
```

## OAuth Flow

To finish the authentication process, your app will have to do the following:

1. Request a client ID and client secret.

2. Request authorization from a ShipBob user.

3. Retrieve an authorization code from a provided callback.

4. Exchange the authorization code for an access token.

5. Begin making API calls.

### Step 0: Get Familiar with OAuth 2.0

At ShipBob, we use OAuth 2.0 for its robust security and relatively universal implementations.

If you’re not familiar, you can read more about working with OAuth’s hybrid flow [here](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/grant/hybrid).

<Note>If you want to use Postman or a similar tool to hit our API endpoints during testing, ensure that your redirect URL is set up EXACTLY as you entered when you requested access, and Postman is set up for OAuth 2.0</Note>

### Step 1: Request a Client ID and Secret for your Application

Begin by filling out and submitting this form to request a client ID and secret. Once approved, we will email you the ID and secret, as well as your approved API scopes.

In addition to requesting scopes, you will need to provide us with a list of callback URIs. Please provide us with callback URIs that don't include a hash (fragments). URLs that include hashes (fragments) will result in errors. These URIs provided must exactly match any endpoint you will use as a callback when calling /connect/authorize. This means including any https:// prefix and appropriate slugs. For security reasons, please only use domains that you can control - e.g. if you are from ACME, Co you should use something like https://acme.co/shipbobintegrationtest

You may request access for the following scopes:

| Scope              | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| orders\_read       |             |
| orders\_write      |             |
| products\_read     |             |
| products\_write    |             |
| fulfillments\_read |             |
| inventory\_read    |             |
| channels\_read     |             |
| receiving\_read    |             |
| receiving\_write   |             |
| returns\_read      |             |
| returns\_write     |             |
| webhooks\_read     |             |
| webhooks\_write    |             |
| locations\_read    |             |
| offline\_access    |             |

### Step 2: Request Permission to See User's Data

<Note>if you do not yet have a ShipBob user in mind - you can sign up for a free demo account here: https://web.shipbob.com/app/Merchant/#/SignUp. The demo period does not expire and you can effectively use this as a sandbox to test API calls for your application to your user account.</Note>

Once you have your client ID and secret, you can use them to get a user’s permission to access their account data. You start by making a request to the following endpoint:

```
GET https://auth.shipbob.com/connect/authorize
```

The following query parameters are allowed for this endpoint:

<Note>These parameters must be URL encoded, particularly <code>redirect\_uri</code>.</Note>

A very basic example call to our integrate endpoint will look like this:

```
GET https://auth.shipbob.com/connect/authorize?
   client_id=MyCoolClient&
   scope=products_read channels_read offline_access&
   redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.myapp.com%2Fintegrate%2Fshipbob%2Fcallback
```

### Step 3: Implement Your Callback URI

Now that you’ve made a call to the "integrate" endpoint, the granting of permission is entirely within the user’s hands. Whether they grant or not, your application must implement a GET endpoint with the following URI fragment parameters:

By default, we will call the following:

```
https://www.myapp.com/integrate/shipbob/callback#
   code=some_access_code&
   id_token=some_open_id_token&
   state=provided_state&
   scope=channels_read orders_read orders_write
```

<Note>Note: the data will return as a fragment, not a query string.</Note>

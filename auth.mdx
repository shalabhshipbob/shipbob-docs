ShipBob's Developer API allows two forms of authentication, depending on the use case: Personal Access Token (PAT) or OAuth 2.0.

## Prerequisite

To generate authentication credentials, you must have an account on the ShipBob dashboard. If you don’t have one, you can sign up:

* [Sign up for Production Environment](https://web.shipbob.com/app/Merchant/#/SignUp)

* [Sign up for Sandbox Environment](https://webstage.shipbob.dev/app/Merchant/#/SignUp)

## Supported Authentication Methods

ShipBob offers two authentication methods based on integration needs:

### Personal Access Token (PAT) Flow

If you're building a **single-user** custom integration, use this method. It generates a ready-to-use bearer-type token with full access to the merchant's account.

* **Generate credentials from the ShipBob dashboard:**

  * [Production Environment](https://web.shipbob.com/app/merchant/#/Integrations/token-management)

  * [Sandbox Environment](https://webstage.shipbob.dev/app/merchant/#/Integrations/token-management)

### OAuth Flow

If you are building a **multi-user** integration or an app listed on our App Store, you must use OAuth.

* **Generate credentials from the ShipBob dashboard:**

  * [Production Environment](https://web.shipbob.com/app/merchant/#/Integrations/oauth-apps)

  * [Sandbox Environment](https://webstage.shipbob.dev/app/merchant/#/Integrations/oauth-apps)

<Note>
  All API authentication operates against the root user of the account. When requesting a PAT token or installing an OAuth app, do so against the root user.
</Note>

## Personal Access Token (PAT) Flow

When you request your first PAT, ShipBob automatically generates an application ("SMA" or single-merchant application) and [channel](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs#tag/Channels) to house all your future PATs. You can request multiple tokens and revoke them anytime.

<Note>
  These tokens do not expire, so exercise caution when sharing them.
</Note>

### Using Your PAT

To authenticate API requests, include the PAT in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Bearer [your_api_token]
```

Before making API calls, retrieve your **channel ID** using the [GET Channel](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs#tag/Channels) endpoint:

```json
{
    "id": 56232,
    "name": "Personal Access Token - March 19, 2020",
    "application_name": "SMA",
    "scopes": [
        "channels_read", "orders_read", "orders_write", "products_read", "products_write",
        "receiving_read", "receiving_write", "returns_read", "returns_write", "inventory_read"
    ]
}
```

## OAuth Flow

To authenticate via OAuth, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Generate a Client ID and Secret

Generate credentials from the ShipBob dashboard:

* [Production Environment](https://web.shipbob.com/app/merchant/#/Integrations/oauth-apps)

* [Sandbox Environment](https://webstage.shipbob.dev/app/merchant/#/Integrations/oauth-apps)

### Step 2: Request Permission to Access User Data

Make a `GET` request to:

```bash
GET https://auth.shipbob.com/connect/authorize
```

Include the following query parameters (URL-encoded):

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `client_id`    | Your client ID (from Step 1).                                                                        |
| `scope`        | Space-separated list of scopes granted in Step 1. If using refresh tokens, include `offline_access`. |
| `redirect_uri` | Callback URI that must match one provided during client registration.                                |
| `state`        | Recommended for preventing replay attacks; echoed back in the callback.                              |
| `nonce`        | A random string to prevent token replay attacks.                                                     |

#### Example Request

```bash
GET https://auth.shipbob.com/connect/authorize?
   client_id=MyCoolClient&
   scope=products_read channels_read offline_access&
   redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.myapp.com%2Fintegrate%2Fshipbob%2Fcallback
```

### Step 3: Implement Your Callback URI

When the user grants access, ShipBob redirects to your callback URI with the following parameters:

```bash
https://www.myapp.com/integrate/shipbob/callback#
   code=some_access_code&
   id_token=some_open_id_token&
   state=provided_state&
   scope=channels_read orders_read orders_write
```

<Note>
  The data returns as a fragment, not a query string.
</Note>

### Step 4: Obtain an Access Token

Exchange the authorization code for an access token by making a `POST` request:

```bash
POST https://auth.shipbob.com/connect/token

redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.myapp.com%2Fintegrate%2Fshipbob%2Fcallback
&client_id=MyCoolApp
&client_secret=someSecret
&code=code_from_step_3
&grant_type=authorization_code
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "access_token": "your_api_token",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

If using `offline_access`, a `refresh_token` will also be provided. Use it to obtain new tokens without requiring user login:

```bash
POST https://auth.shipbob.com/connect/token

redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.myapp.com%2Fintegrate%2Fshipbob%2Fcallback
&client_id=MyCoolApp
&client_secret=someSecret
&refresh_token=refresh_token_from_step_4
&grant_type=refresh_token
```

<Note>
  Access tokens expire in 1 hour. Refresh tokens are valid for 30 days.
</Note>

### Step 5: Retrieve Your Channel ID

All API requests must include `shipbob_channel_id` in headers. Retrieve it via:

```bash
GET https://api.shipbob.com/1.0/channel
```

Example Response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 12345,
    "name": "integration_name_unique_to_user"
  }
]
```

You’re now ready to make authenticated API requests using ShipBob!

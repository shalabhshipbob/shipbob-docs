ShipBob webhooks automatically notify your app when key events occur, allowing you to keep your data in sync.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Subscribe to webhooks">
    Create a [webhook](https://shipbob.mintlify.app/api-reference/webhooks/create-a-new-webhook-subscription?playground=open) to subscribe to an event and define a **subscription URL**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive Webhook Events">
    When the event occurs, ShipBob sends a `POST` request to your **subscription URL** with relevant data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Acknowledge Receipt">
    Your system should return a `2XX` response to confirm successful receipt.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Handle Retries">
    If no `2XX` response is received, ShipBob **retries delivery for up to 24 hours** using an **exponential backoff strategy**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Concepts

* **Subscription**: A request to receive webhook notifications at a specified URL.

* **Subscription URL**: The endpoint where webhook data is sent.

* **Event**: A trigger that generates webhook data (e.g., an order being shipped).

* **Topic**: The category of event data being sent.

* **Payload**: The actual event data sent in the webhook.

* **Response**: A `2XX` HTTP response is required to confirm webhook receipt.

***

## Common Use Cases

* ✅ **Real-time Order Tracking** - Receive `order_shipped` and `shipment_delivered` events to provide live tracking updates to customers.

* ✅ **Inventory Management** - Monitor `shipment_exception` events to detect and respond to stock shortages.

* ✅ **Automated Customer Notifications** - Trigger automated emails or SMS notifications when shipments are delayed (`shipment_onhold`) or delivered (`shipment_delivered`).

* ✅ **Order Cancellation Handling** - Use `shipment_cancelled` events to update your system when a shipment is canceled.

* ✅ **Multi-Channel Support** - Filter webhook data by **sales channel** to manage orders from different platforms separately.

## Webhook Topics & Events

| **Topic**            | **Description**                                                                                                                         | **Scopes Required**                  |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `order_shipped`      | Fires when a shipping label is purchased, printed, and scanned. If the order is split into multiple shipments, this fires per shipment. | `orders_read`                        |
| `shipment_delivered` | Fires when a shipment is delivered to the customer.                                                                                     | `orders_read` or `fulfillments_read` |
| `shipment_exception` | Fires when a shipment is moved to exception status (e.g., out-of-stock items).                                                          | `orders_read` or `fulfillments_read` |
| `shipment_onhold`    | Fires when a shipment moves to **On-Hold** status due to missing information (e.g., address issues).                                    | `orders_read` or `fulfillments_read` |
| `shipment_cancelled` | Fires when a shipment is canceled. Does **not** fire for manually canceled or imported orders.                                          | `orders_read` or `fulfillments_read` |

## Webhook Headers

ShipBob sends webhook notifications with the following headers:

```json
{
  "shipbob-subscription-id": "1582",
  "shipbob-topic": "order_shipped",
  "content-type": "application/json; charset=utf-8"
}
```

***

## Webhook Payloads (Example Responses)

Unless specified in the table above, the webhook notification sends the full data model of the underlying resource, that is available in the GET endpoint.

## Best Practices

✅ **Use HTTPS** - Subscription URLs **must** support SSL. Use RequestBin for testing if needed.

✅ **Implement Redundancy** - Webhooks **may be delayed or lost**. Use `GET` endpoints to periodically reconcile data.

✅ **Retry Handling** - Events **may arrive out of order** due to retries—handle them as independent updates.

✅ **Use Idempotency** - Store webhook event `id`s and discard duplicates to prevent redundant processing.

✅ **Logging & Monitoring** - Log webhook requests and responses to diagnose issues.

***

## Troubleshooting Guide

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook Not Triggering?" defaultOpen={false}>
    * Ensure your **subscription URL is correct** and **publicly accessible**.

    * Confirm your app **returns a `2XX` response** to ShipBob’s `POST` request.

    * Verify that your app **has the correct `webhooks_read` or `webhooks_write` permissions**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webhook Retries Are Overloading My Server" defaultOpen={false}>
    * Ensure your system **processes events efficiently** and responds within **5 seconds**.

    * Return a `2XX` response **before** doing heavy processing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webhook Data is Out of Order" defaultOpen={false}>
    * Use timestamps from the payload to **sort events properly**.

    * Handle events **individually**, rather than relying on strict order.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Receiving Duplicate Events?" defaultOpen={false}>
    * Webhooks **are not guaranteed to be sent only once**.

    * Implement **idempotency checks**: Store received event IDs and ignore duplicates.

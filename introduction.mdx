ShipBob is a technology-first fulfillment & storage provider for e-commerce merchants. With a distributed network of fulfillment centers across the US, we allow fast, affordable shipping to thousands of customers. Read more about us [here](https://www.shipbob.com/about/).

There are two methods of using this API: a "Personal Access Token (PAT)" for single-merchant or custom integrations, and an OAuth 2.0 process for general-purpose integrations or those that will be listed on ShipBob's App Marketplace. Please see the Auth tab for more details.

## API Access

Before you are able to interact with ShipBob's API, you must have an account. Accounts are free until physical inventory arrives, and the trial period does not expire.

## Support & Rate Limits

If you have questions, please email our Developer Support Team at [developers@shipbob.com](mailto:developers@shipbob.com). This will create a ticket with a 1-business day first response time.

API calls will be rate-limited to 150 requests per-minute using a sliding window, and will be totalled per user, per application across calls to any of the Shipbob APIs.

## FAQ

Please review our documentation thoroughly. Common issues that come up are listed here:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I see my products in the ShipBob UI?">
    We are undergoing a schema migration to better support new features. Thus, the API has concepts - like "product" - which are not yet reflected in the UI. What you see on the UI is an inventory item, which is automatically created when you send us a channel product.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why can't I submit an order for a product that already exists in ShipBob's UI?">
    At ShipBob you must create “channel product” records in our system in order to create orders. This is so we always have a unique and immutable tie to the upstream system, which reduces the risk of line item errors and order duplication. You cannot create orders with inventory\_ids or with products created from other sources. Please review our documentation:

    There are 2 ways to create products for your convenience:

    1. Create the products via the Product POST. If you pass through a SKU that already exists in the ShipBob UI as the product’s “reference\_id”, we will automatically merge that product to the existing inventory. Otherwise, the merchant will have to manually “merge” the items using our UI

    2. Create the products using both the <code>reference\_id</code> and <code>name</code> fields in the line item field for the Order POST. We will auto-create any unrecognized products given both reference\_id and name are provided when you send us orders. This replaces the products sync step described above. Similarly, we will auto-merge the items in the manner described above if appropriate.

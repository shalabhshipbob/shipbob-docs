## API Access

Before you are able to interact with ShipBob's API, you must have an account. Accounts are free until physical inventory arrives, and the trial period does not expire.

## Support & Rate Limits

If you have questions, please email our Developer Support Team at [developers@shipbob.com](mailto:developers@shipbob.com). This will create a ticket with a 1-business day first response time.

API calls will be rate-limited to 150 requests per-minute using a sliding window, and will be totalled per user, per application across calls to any of the Shipbob APIs.

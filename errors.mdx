description: 'In the events of API request errors, ShipBob uses conventional HTTP response codes in the 4XX and 5XX range to indicate the reason behind the error.'
---

ShipBob uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g. a required parameter was missing, a duplicate reference ID already exists, etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with ShipBob's servers.

| HTTP Status Code Summary |                   |                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 200                      | OK                | Everything worked as expected.                                                                   |
| 400                      | Bad Request       | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.                         |
| 401                      | Unauthorized      | No valid API key provided.                                                                       |
| 403                      | Forbidden         | The API key doesn’t have permissions to perform the request.                                     |
| 404                      | Not Found         | The requested resource doesn’t exist.                                                            |
| 429                      | Too Many Requests | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. |

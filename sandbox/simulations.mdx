## What Are Sandbox Simulations?

Sandbox Simulations let you:

* Test your integration with realistic, production-like data.

* Simulate actions that happen in a ShipBob facility (e.g., shipping or delivering an order).

* Spot and fix issues before they happen in real life.

Think of it as a practice run—everything works like the real thing, but no actual shipments are made.

***

## Step 1: Get Set Up

Before you can start simulating, you’ll need to set up your Sandbox environment. Here’s how:

1. **Sign Up for the Sandbox Environment**

   * Go [here](#) to sign up.

   * Note: Your live (production) data won’t carry over—this is a fresh, clean slate.

2. **Generate an API Access Token**

   * Choose the token type that fits your needs:

     * **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Best for a single merchant. Generate it from the Sandbox ShipBob dashboard ([detailed steps here](#)).

     * **OAuth**: Great for apps used by multiple merchants (e.g., a Shopify connector). Get credentials from the dashboard ([detailed steps here](#)).

   * Learn more about tokens [here](#).

3. **Use the Right Base URLs**

   * For API calls: [`https://sandbox-api.shipbob.com/2.0/`](https://sandbox-api.shipbob.com/2.0/)

   * For authentication: [`https://authstage.shipbob.com/`](https://authstage.shipbob.com/)

## Step 2: Understand How Simulations Work

Here’s the basic flow:

1. Send a request to a Simulation API endpoint.

2. Get a **simulation ID** in response.

3. The simulation runs in the background (it might take a little time to complete).

***

## Step 3: Pick an Action to Simulate

In the Sandbox, you can currently simulate these self-service actions:

* **Mark a Shipment/Order as Shipped**

* **Mark a Shipment/Order as Delivered**

Want to test other actions (like adding inventory or creating returns)? Email [`developers@shipbob.com`](mailto:developers@shipbob.com) with your request and the email tied to your Sandbox account.

***

## Step 4: Prepare Your Shipment for Simulation

Before you run a simulation, make sure your shipment is ready. Here’s what you need:

* **Inventory**: The shipment’s products must have inventory in one of these fulfillment centers:

  * Cicero (IL)

  * Moreno Valley (CA)

  * Need inventory? Email [`developers@shipbob.com`](mailto:developers@shipbob.com).

* **Packaging Preferences**: Set these up in the Merchant App Dashboard under Products > \[Your Product] > Packaging Preferences.

* **Customs Info (for International Shipments)**: Add this in the Merchant App Dashboard under Products > \[Your Product] > Customs Information.

* **Fulfillment Center**: Ensure inventory exists in the chosen center. Learn more [here](#).

  * Want a different center? Email [`developers@shipbob.com`](mailto:developers@shipbob.com) or check [this article](#).

* **Shipment Status**: It can’t be On-Hold, Exception, or Canceled.

* **Dummy Payment Method**: Add a test credit card:

  * Log in to the Merchant App Dashboard > Your Account > Payment Details.

  * Use card number `4111 1111 1111 1111` (more options [here](#)), plus any name, email, CVC, and expiration date.

## Step 5: Run a Simulation

Here’s how to send a simulation request:

### Example Requests

**Mark an Order as Shipped**

```json POST https://sandbox-api.shipbob.com/2.0/simulate/shipment [expandable]
{
    "shipment_id": 11471145,
    "simulation": {
        "action": "ShipOrder",
        "delay": null,
        "next": null
    }
}
```

**Mark an Order as Delivered**

```json POST https://sandbox-api.shipbob.com/2.0/simulate/shipment [expandable]
{
    "shipment_id": 11471145,
    "simulation": {
        "action": "ShipOrder",
        "delay": null,
        "next": null
    }
}
```

**Mark as Shipped, Then Delivered**

```json POST https://sandbox-api.shipbob.com/2.0/simulate/shipment [expandable]
 {
     "shipment_id": 11471145,
     "simulation": {
         "action": "ShipOrder",
         "delay": null,
         "next": {
             "action": "DeliverOrder",
             "delay": null
         }
     }
 }
```

**Add Delays (e.g., Ship in 5 minutes, Deliver in 10 minutes)**

```json POST https://sandbox-api.shipbob.com/2.0/simulate/shipment [expandable]
 {
     "shipment_id": 11471145,
     "simulation": {
         "action": "ShipOrder",
         "delay": 5,
         "next": {
             "action": "DeliverOrder",
             "delay": 10
         }
     }
 }
```

### What You’ll Get Back

* Success (200): A `simulation_id` and a “Simulation registered successfully” message.

* Errors: Check for `400` (bad request), `404` (shipment not found), or `500` (server issue—contact [support@shipbob.com](mailto:support@shipbob.com) with the error\_id).

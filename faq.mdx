<Accordion title="Why can't I submit an order for a product that already exists in ShipBob's UI?" defaultOpen={false}>
  At ShipBob you must create “channel product” records in our system in order to create orders. This is so we always have a unique and immutable tie to the upstream system, which reduces the risk of line item errors and order duplication. You cannot create orders with inventory\_ids or with products created from other sources. Please review our documentation:

  There are 2 ways to create products for your convenience:

  1. Create the products via the Product POST. If you pass through a SKU that already exists in the ShipBob UI as the product’s “reference\_id”, we will automatically merge that product to the existing inventory. Otherwise, the merchant will have to manually “merge” the items using our UI

  2. Create the products using both the `reference_id` and `name` fields in the line item field for the Order POST. We will auto-create any unrecognized products given both reference\_id and name are provided when you send us orders. This replaces the products sync step described above. Similarly, we will auto-merge the items in the manner described above if appropriate.
